# Digital Audio Signal Processing and Machine Learning Tutorials

This is a repository where I will upload Jupyter notebooks with tutorials on Audio DSP and Machine Learning.

- Dimensionality reduction for audio organization - English
  
  Watch online in: https://github.com/mrpep/Digital-Audio-Signal-Processing-and-Machine-Learning-Tutorials/blob/master/Audio%20exploration.ipynb

  What you will learn:
    - Preparing audio data and extracting features with libROSA.
    - Using sklearn for dimensionality reduction and UMap.
    - Build Convolutional and variational autoencoders in Keras.
    - Combine dimensionality reduction techniques and use them to explore interactively audio.

- Separación de componentes armónicas y percusivas (HPSS) - Spanish
  
  Watch online in:
  https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mrpep/Tutoriales-Procesamiento-de-audio/blob/master/HPSS.ipynb
  
  What you will learn:
    - Use of moving median filters for percussive and harmonic sounds emphasis.
    - Time-frequency domain filtering with binary, soft and hybrid masks.
